        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development: HTML, CSS, and JS.</li>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is the language used to describe the presentation of a website that is created with HTML and how each element on a webpage is rendered.</li>
          <li>Style content: You'll use CSS to add styling to the content you created using HTML. This might include fonts, colors, and spacing.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A free, open source version control system that allows web developers to collaborate on projects without overwriting each other's work.</li>
          <li>Git allows developers to revert to previous versions of the code if a problem is discovered.</li>
          <li>A software on your computer that tracks changes that you make to your code.</li>
          <li>A tool that allows developers and others to use version control.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is used to handle logic and allow users to interact with a website.</li>
          <li>Create logic: You'll use JavaScript to add logic to your webpage, which will allow users to interact with it.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a lightweight programming language that is used to provide logic and interactivity for websites; one of the three core languages of the web.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>2 requirements for JavaScript function: 
            1. Define the function
            2. Call the function for the function to execute</li>
